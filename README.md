# OOP Mastery: Concepts & Projects

This repository explores the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through hands-on projects and examples. Each concept is explained with practical coding exercises that solidify your understanding of OOP.

## Key Topics
- **Encapsulation**: Structuring code to hide internal details and expose only necessary components.
- **Inheritance**: Sharing properties and methods between classes.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing different classes to be treated as instances of the same superclass.
- **Abstraction**: Simplifying complex realities through models and interfaces.

## Projects

### 1. Basic Calculator
This project applies OOP principles to build a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. It demonstrates encapsulation by creating well-structured classes, and abstraction is used to hide complex operations behind simple interfaces. Methods within the calculator classes handle operations like addition, subtraction, and more.

### 2. String Manipulation Library
This project involves creating a utility to perform various string operations. It highlights inheritance and polymorphism by allowing different string manipulation techniques to share common behavior while also demonstrating how objects can behave differently based on the context.

These projects serve as practical examples of how OOP concepts are used to solve real-world programming problems. They encourage the use of reusable, modular code while reinforcing fundamental OOP ideas like encapsulation and polymorphism.
